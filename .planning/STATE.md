## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Auth-first build order — everything downstream depends on performer auth and RLS
- [Roadmap]: DEMO-03/DEMO-04 (animations, toasts) assigned to Phase 2 with capture flow, not Phase 4 polish
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 depends on Phase 1 only (not Phase 3) — fan profile is a parallel track

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Magic link deliverability to Gmail/Outlook must be tested before demo — may need custom SMTP
- [Phase 1]: RLS policies missing for collections/fan_tiers/messages — will cause empty dashboard if not fixed
- [Phase 1]: /api/claim accepts any user_id without verification — security hole
